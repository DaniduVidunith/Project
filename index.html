  <p>Studies suggest How may I help you officer? is the single most disarming thing to say and not What's the problem?
    Studies suggest it’s best the help reply My pleasure and not No problem. Studies suggest it’s best not to mention
    problem in front of power even to say there is none. Gloria Steinem says women lose power as they age and yet the
    loudest voice in my head is my mother. Studies show the mother we have in mind isn’t the mother that exists. Mine
    says: What the fuck are you crying for? Studies show the baby monkey will pick the fake monkey with fake fur over
    the furless wire monkey with milk, without contest. Studies show to negate something is to think it anyway.
